CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) i**s** the process of automating the construction, testing, and deployment of software. 

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically integrate source code from multiple developers into a main branch, testing to ensure there are no errors.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Once the code is integrated, the deployment process to the production environment is also automated.

CI/CD helps accelerate development, reduce the risk of errors, and improve software quality through automating the development and deployment process.
